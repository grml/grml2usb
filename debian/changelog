  [ Michael Prokop ]
  * Update documentation regarding syslinux and FAT32 (thanks to
    Stefan Traby <stefan@hello-penguin.com> for the hint).
  * Changes with regards to Ulrich's work:
    - Add a check to identify old ISOs which do not ship
      a default.cfg file and abort then. We have to break
      backward compatibility, otherwise the isolinux/syslinux
      code would become worse than it's already nowadays.
    - Search for isolinux files in /boot/isolinux/ so the
      correct grml.png is used.
    - Support setting bootoptions in syslinux.cfg
  * Drop duplicated boot=live references in kernel cmdline.
  * Apply patch from Thorsten Glaser which prepares code for
    his future[tm] work.
  * Raise CriticalException if filesystem.module, kernel or
    initrd are not present.
  * Avoid the "file is read only, overwrite anyway (y/n) ?"
    question of mtools by syslinux.
  * Inform user when using grub as bootloader.
  * Make syslinux the default bootloader (drop --syslinux,
    add --grub instead). Grub fails just too often.

    directory so /usr/share/grml2usb isn't necessarily needed.
    Thanks for the patch to Alexander 'Leo' Bergolth <leo@strike.wu.ac.at>!
  * Make sure grub.conf isn't a symlink but a plain file instead,
    otherwise it will break on FAT16 filesystems. This works around
    grub-install of (at least) Fedora 10.
    Thanks for the patch to Alexander 'Leo' Bergolth <leo@strike.wu.ac.at>!
  * Use 'pci=nomsi' in failsafe bootoption. Thanks to Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt.

  * Fix usage of --force in combination with --fat16. Thanks to
    Johannes Endres and Reiko Kaps for the bugreport.

  * Use ascii.pf2 as grub2 font, since grub2 (1.96+20090307-1)
    the old ascii.pff isn't available anymore.
  * Use terminal_output if available, otherwise fallback to old
    older 'terminal'-command (thanks to Felix Zielcke for helping).
  * Document the 'grub-setup fails after Attempting to install GRUB
    to a partition instead of the MBR' issue.
  * Use "set gfxpayload=1024x768x16,1024x768" instead of vga=791 in
    grub2 configuration. This requires a recent version of the linux
    loader as the new linux loader loads the kernel at 32bit entry point
    and not at 16 bit anymore so it has to be translated for the Linux
    kernel (as the kernel parses vga= in 16 bit code). In the long run
    we don't seem to have another option, so let's change it.
    Thanks to Felix Zielcke and Robert Millan for first hand information.
  * Increase timeout from 5 to 10 seconds in grub2 configuration.
  * Load memtest86+ binary via 'linux16' in grub2 (otherwise it fails).
  * Drop the serial boot entry from grub2 (I assume users with usb
    pens don't need that option).
  * Change the way MirOS bsd4grml is loaded (use the fallback method
    as default).
  * Improve descriptions of grml's grub2 entries.

  * Fix creation and installation of grub1's configuration file (menu.lst).

  * Display information about default grml flavour and the other
